# CactusJump

 A simple but challenging game that I made using Python and the Pygame libraries.

 Space bar to jump, q to 'double jump', arrows to move.

Coins give you bonus points, bombs send you flying, and jetpacks boost you rapidly.

To play, download the zip, extract, and run the application (the .exe file, there is currently only a windows build).
